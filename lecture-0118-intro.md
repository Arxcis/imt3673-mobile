**What is Android?**

- Reuse OS
- Google is tightening up the Android spec
- Strictly JAVA in the beginning, loosening up to access C++ directly or Kotlin.
- Apple thought only web was necessary. Had to redesign later to allow native apps.

@question - Apps killed? or just paused?

@question - But later allow apps to communicate with each other through API. It is just whitelisting, instead of blacklisting communication between apps?

- SQLite was only database before, now you can plug in different DB through abstraction layer.

@What is a just in time compiler?@

- Multi-core machines can have dedicated threads, pre-compiling without much performance benefit. Game 7 threads, Compiler 1 thread.
